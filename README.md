# Capsol
Capsol will provide a system in which customers requiring medicinal drugs as well as the nearby pharmacies from which the customer would retrieve these drugs can directly interact.
The project can be imported into such an IDE as Eclipse. Only the Capsol class is to be run (It is the only one that has a main class). All navigation through the demo begins there. 
There are two potential major users of the system: Customer and Pharmacy. Due to the industry associated with the system, the demographic is extremely wide; anyone who requires medication is an intended audience. Also, a licensed pharmacy is an intended user of Capsol.
The program is written in JavaSwing, it is a high level functional prototype/demo. I plan to make this a web application in the near future, using the HTML, Javascript and CSS.
The program is self-explanatory: Each window is used for specific operations explicitely spelt out on the window
