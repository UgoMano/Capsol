# Capsol
Capsol will provide a system in which customers requiring medicinal drugs as well as the nearby pharmacies from which the customer would retrieve these drugs can directly interact.
The project can be imported into such an IDE as Eclipse. Only the Capsol class is to be run (It is the only one that has a main class). All navigation through the demo begins there.
